# Computer-Vision-Project
This repository is a learning project consisting in building a Convolutional Neural Network to predict facial keypoints on a face image. It introduces basic elements of a convolutional network (maxpooling for instance). The architecture of the network is stored in the file models.py. The CNN contains 5 convolutional layers followed by maxpooling layers as well as 4 linear layers and is coded in pytorch.
