# Computer-Vision-Project
This project consists in building a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the pixels of an image that contain facial keypoints. The architecture of the network is stored in the file models.py. The CNN contains 5 convolutional layers followed by maxpooling layers as well as 4 linear layers.
